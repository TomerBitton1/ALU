# ALU

1. Introduction

The VHDL ALU is a digital circuit that performs arithmetic and logic operations on binary data. It can be used as a component within a larger digital system, such as a microprocessor. The ALU in this project is implemented using the VHDL hardware description language.

2. Prerequisites

Before you can work with this VHDL ALU project, you should have the following:
- VHDL Simulator: You need a VHDL simulator to simulate and test the ALU design. Popular options include ModelSim and Xilinx Vivado.
- Familiarity with VHDL: Basic knowledge of VHDL and digital logic design principles will be helpful.

3. Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:
- ALU.vhd, The main VHDL file for the ALU design.
- ALU.do, A do file for simulating the ALU.
- Waveform.

4. Supported Operations

The ALU in this project supports various arithmetic and logic operations, including:
- Addition
- Subtraction
- Multiplication
- Division
- Logical Shift Left
- Logical Shift Right
- Logical AND
- Logical OR
- Logical XOR
- Logical NOR
- Logical NAND
- Logical XNOR

5. Simulation

- Modify the DO file (ALU.do) to include the ALU instantiation and test cases.
- Use your VHDL simulator ( ModelSim or Xilinx Vivado) to compile and simulate.
- Analyze the simulation results to ensure the ALU operates correctly for your use case.
